# A docker-compose must always start by the version tag.
# We use "3" because it's the last version at this time.
version: "3"

# You should know that docker-composes works with services.
# 1 service = 1 container.
# For example, a service maybe, a server, a client, a database...
# We use the keyword 'services' to start to create services.
services:
  # We use the keyword 'client' for the server.
  client:
    # Here 'client/ corresponds to the path to the client folder
    # that contains the Dockerfile to use.
    build: usr/src/client/

    # The command to execute once the image is created.
    # The following command will execute "python ./client.py".
    command: python ./client.py

    # The keyword 'network_mode' is used to define the network type.
    # Here we define that the container can access to the 'localhost' of the computer.
    network_mode: host
